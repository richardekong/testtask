      API
      users list: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
      user avatars: https://avatars.io/twitter/{user.id} (i. e. use https://avatars.io/twitter/4 for user with id = 4)
       
       3) User Details Screen
       Displays detail user's info.
        
	UI
	Data should be displayed vertically (top-->bottom):
	- name
	- email. Tapping on it should provide possibility to send an email to this address.
	- phone. Tapping on it should provide possibility to make call.
	Rest of the screen shall be splitted into 2 equal parts horizontally:
	- web view with opened website from user's data
	- map view with user's address pin. Animate and zoom map (street level). Tapping on pin should show popup with address's street
	 
	 Optional ussues:
	 1) Handle portrait + landscape orientations on non-tablet devices.
	 2) Support tablet devices. Landscape mode only. Use different design patterns for both mobile and tablet: http://developer.android.com/images/fundamentals/fragments.png ("Users Screen" to the left and "User Details Screen" to the right).
	 3) Provide data cache. User should be able to browse the app even if data fetching from server has failed. If there is no cached data yet (1st app launch), notify user (show error message).
